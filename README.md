    - NOTICE:
        - 1. this folder contains a simplified version of the exploit generation code extracted from the main codebase of JAEX.
        - 2. we only present the exploit templates for different types of vulnerabilities. How these templates are used to generate concrete exploit code in different contexts can be seen in the complete version of JAEX, which will be provided during the Artifacts Evaluation process.
